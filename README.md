# cub3D - My First RayCaster with miniLibX 🌐

## 📜 Introduction
This project is inspired by the historically significant game **Wolfenstein 3D**, the pioneer of first-person shooters. In this project, I've explored the fundamentals of ray-casting to create a dynamic first-person view inside a maze. The goal is to navigate through the maze successfully, showcasing my understanding of graphical programming and algorithm implementation using C and miniLibX.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Rigor**: Adhering strictly to project guidelines.
- **Programming in C**: Utilizing my skills in C for complex algorithms.
- **Graphic Design**: Handling windows, colors, and events effectively.
- **Mathematics**: Employing mathematical concepts to develop elegant and efficient algorithms.

## 🖥️ Features
- Realistic 3D rendering of a maze from a first-person perspective using Ray-Casting.
- Smooth window management including minimization and focus changes.
- Texture mapping for walls with different textures based on orientation (North, South, East, West).
- Customizable floor and ceiling colors.
- Navigation through the maze using keyboard controls (W, A, S, D, and arrow keys).
- Clean exit strategies using ESC key or window close button.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **C Programming**: The entire project is implemented in C for optimal control over graphics and performance.
- **miniLibX**: Utilized for creating windows and handling graphics rendering.
- **Git**: Version control and project management.
- **Math Library**: Used for various mathematical calculations essential for ray-casting.
